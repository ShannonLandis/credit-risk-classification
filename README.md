The code credit_risk_classification.ipynb imports the lending_data.csv file from the resources folder.
The code splits the data into training and test data
the fields are then scaled prior to running through 3 different regression models.
This code compares results of the Logistic Regression model, the Decision Tree model, and the K-Nearest Neighbor model
after each is trained using the training data set and tested using the test data set.

The results are reflected in the code file.
